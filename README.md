# transfer_test

To test how repo behave after get transferring to another owner

https://github.com/kotliary/transfer_test should redirect to https://github.com/niaid/transfer_test

If I fork the repo back to my account, the redirection stops working. But after removing the fork, it works again.

Test if I can make a commit/push from RStudio...
Works from RStudio using either kotliary/transfer_test or niaid/transfer_test.
